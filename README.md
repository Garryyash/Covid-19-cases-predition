# Covid-19 cases predition
 
# Description
 Created an deep learning model with LSTM to predict Covid-19 daily cases for the next 30 days with the relevance pf past cases trend data with an MAPE accuracy of 0.16 during training.

## Project Introduction
The year 2020 was a catastrophic year for humanity. Pneumonia of unknown
aetiology was first reported in December 2019., since then, COVID-19 spread to
the whole world and became a global pandemic. More than 200 countries were
affected due to pandemic and many countries were trying to save precious lives
of their people by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, social distances, event
postponements and lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus. However, due
to lackadaisical attitude, efforts attempted by the governments were jeopardised,
thus, predisposing to the wide spread of virus and lost of lives.
It is believed that the absence of AI assisted automated tracking and
predicting system is the cause of the wide spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Hence,
proposed the usage of deep learning model to predict the daily
COVID cases to determine if travel bans should be imposed or rescinded 

## How to Install and Run the Project
1. Download the file
2. Load in Spyder
3. run F5 (dont change the code unnesscary to avoid preogramme malfunction)
4. let the training to begin
5. open spyder command prompt to load TensorBoard with logs using --logdir <filepath>
6. If no error is thrown, go to any browser and type localhost:6006 to see the graph plots
